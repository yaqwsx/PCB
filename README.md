# PCB

Collection of my small or one-time PCBs, which do not worth a standalone
repository. Boards in this repository are usually small devices, tests, etc.
Almost every board in this repository is a 15 minute quick-off, so do not expect
nice PCB layout or detailed description. However, every project should have a
short readme.
